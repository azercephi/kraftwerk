1) How to visualize graphs?

2) More simulated runs? Not just against TA-degree, but pit all?
	(or a 'large enough' sample) against each other?

3) Look at performance of past days. Why did we lose? Why do our blended algorithms work well?

4) make sure we beat TA-degree

5) Check parallel top_betweenness, top_closeness

6) Try spectral clustering - how clustered?
	pick 'best' node (highest degree?) in every? cluster
	
7) blend results together from top_ev and top_closeness and top_deg?
