For this run, we took the top $n$ nodes from eigenvector centrality,
degree-centrality, Katz centrality, closeness centrality, dispersion
centrality.

We rank the top nodes from each centrality measure, and take the top 12
'most promising' (ie most highly ranked across the measures) and generate all
12C10 = 66 possible choices of these nodes. Then, we pit all these 'promising'
samples against TA-degree and choose the top 10 winning samples.

Then we populate our prediction with the top 10 winning samples in order,
repeated.
